# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is the project on technical analysis, visualization, and prediction using data provided by Google Finance. By looking at data from the stock market, particularly some giant technology stocks and others. Used pandas to get stock information, visualized different aspects of it, and finally looked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. Predicted future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to comparatively analyze the effectiveness of prediction algorithms on stock market data and get general insight on this data through visualization to predict future stock behavior and value at risk for each stock. The project encompasses the concept of Data Mining and Statistics. This project makes heavy use of NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization Libraries.

**Stock Market Analysis and Prediction** is a comprehensive project aimed at performing technical analysis, visualization, and prediction of stock prices using historical data from Google Finance. The analysis focuses on major technology stocks and other key stocks to gain insights into their performance, risks, and potential future trends.  

The project begins by using **pandas** to retrieve and process stock data, enabling a deep dive into historical trends. Various aspects of the data are visualized to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies, which aid in understanding stock behavior. Risk analysis is performed by evaluating the historical performance of stocks, helping to assess the likelihood of losses under different scenarios. The project culminates in predicting future stock prices using the **Monte Carlo simulation**, a statistical method that generates multiple possible outcomes based on the stock's past performance and volatility.  

The **purpose** of this project is twofold:  
1. To compare the effectiveness of different prediction algorithms applied to stock market data.  
2. To extract actionable insights from stock data through visualization and statistical analysis, enabling a better understanding of future stock behavior and calculating the value at risk for each stock.  

The project heavily incorporates concepts of **Data Mining and Statistics** while relying on tools such as **NumPy, Pandas, and visualization libraries** like Matplotlib and Seaborn. These tools are used for efficient data handling, statistical computations, and creating visually compelling representations of the data. Through these methods, the project bridges the gap between stock market analysis and predictive modeling, providing a foundation for informed decision-making in financial markets.
